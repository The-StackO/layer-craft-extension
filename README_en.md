**LayerCraft** is a browser extension that gives you the superpower to "modify" any website. Whether you want to play a prank, optimize your reading experience, or touch up content before taking a screenshot, LayerCraft works like a magic sticker, allowing you to make changes easily and "peel them off" anytime.

Our goal is to empower every user to create freely on the web, just like a designer.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development Guide

Before you begin, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher recommended) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/The-StackO/layer-craft-extension
    cd layer-craft-extension
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Chrome Browser

-   **Run Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command starts the development server, generates the unpacked extension files in the `.output/chrome-mv3-dev` directory, and automatically opens Chrome for debugging. For more details, see [WXT - Browser StartUp](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/config/browser-startup.html).

-   **Build for Production**
    ```bash
    npm run build && npm run zip
    ```
    This will first build the production version in `.output/chrome-mv3` and then pack it into a `layer-craft-extension-chrome-mv3.zip` file, located in the `.output` folder at the project root.

### Firefox Browser

-   **Run Development Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev:firefox
    ```
    This command starts the development server, generates the unpacked extension files in the `.output/firefox-mv2-dev` directory, and automatically opens Firefox for debugging. For more details, see [WXT - Browser StartUp](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/config/browser-startup.html).

-   **Build for Production**
    ```bash
    npm run build:firefox && npm run zip:firefox
    ```
    This will first build the production version in `.output/firefox-mv2` and then pack it into a `layer-craft-extension-firefox-mv2.zip` file, located in the `.output` folder at the project root.
